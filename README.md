## Purpose of the Website

The purpose of this e-commerence website, is that it is a shop for oregono oil and other infusions. You will be able to buy different types of infused oil, as well as pure oil..you will also be able to buy clothing and merchanize. The purpose of the site is to be a easy understandable purchasing online shop.

# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)

## First Time user goals:

When the visitor first visits the restaurant booking system:

* The homepage should be clear of what the websites goals are.
* The webpage will clearly show you what you can buy.
* When you chose a item, you should be able to pick how many you would like to pick.
* The header and footer should be clear and easy for the customer to navigate.
* The customer should be able to make a account.
* The customer should be able to create testimonials.
* The user should be able to toggle the shopping basket, if they wish to add or delete.
* There should be clear pictures and information of the uses of the oil.
* The customer should be able to securely pay for a item.
* The customers log in information and payment information is protected.

## Frequent Visitor goals:

* There should be a place where customers can log in, if they wish.
* The customer should be able to browse, shop and pay for items on the site.
* The site should be accessible, with or without a account.
* The site should promote business and give explanantion on what the product is and why it promotes health, this should generate more sales.
* The site works as a iformation site as well as a shop. 

## Website owner goals:

* In the site there is a admin page, here you can add all products and pictures.
* I have used the superuser function, to create a private admin log in for the website ownwer.
* The admin page is also connected, so the site owner can manage the products, pictires, prices and info.


# Color Scheme

The colour scheme is that of a white background to keep things professional and then pops of colour in the site. The colours will be based upon more natural hues, such as:

* blue, green and yellow.
* normal shade of white
* basic shade of black

  The reason for the colou choice is a health product, so it made sense to use more natural colours from nature.

# Typography

I choose the font '' this font has a nice clear look, which is a little bit like clear fancy handwriting, this stands out well and fits the style of the restaurant.
