## Purpose of the Website

The purpose of this e-commerence website, is that it is a shop for oregono oil and other infusions. You will be able to buy different types of infused oil, as well as pure oil. This site will contain 

# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)

## First Time user goals:

When the visitor first visits the restaurant booking system:

* The homepage should be clear of what the websites goals are.
* The booking form should be clear and show which dates are booked and which are not.
* The booking form should give options to book a event or a table.
* The table booking should give the following options: How many, time and date.
* The events booking form should give the following options: How many, time, , as well as which event is requested.
* The site should look good and function on all devices.
* You shoud be able enter your name and email and receive a booking confirmation on the screen.
* The comments and likes section, should be clear and should allow logged in clients to edit there own posts, and like and or unlike.
* The comments section, eventually should act more as a review section, but this will be made in future as a fucntionality improvement.

## Frequent Visitor goals:

* There should be a place where customers can log in, if they wish.
* As a frequent visitor you should be greeted by colourful but soft graphics. The site is to be used for bookngs, but in the future could as a website for a restuarant, as for the moment this is a separate booking site to the restaurants own site.
* You shoukd be able to log in and see your booked tabkes or event...though this is a function I plan to add in the future.

## Website owner goals:

* In the site there is a admin page, inside this page it records all comments and likes to be controlled by the website owner.
* I have used the superuser function, to create a private admin log in for the website ownwer.
* The admin page is also connected to the bookings form, so the site owner can see booking made for both events and tables.
* The website should be useful to the restaurant, easy to use and provides a better solution than other third party booking systems.
* The site is intended to make it easier for the owner to keep track of bookings and avoid extra costs of using a third party booking system.
* A future function woul be a function in the admin page that gives the administrator a oppurtunity to decline bookings.


# Color Scheme

The colour scheme is that of a white background to keep things professional and then pops of colour in the site. The colours will be based upon more natural hues, such as:

* blue, green and yellow.
* normal shade of white
* basic shade of black

  The reason for the colou choice is the restaraunt is a based upon salad and healthy food, so it made sense to use more natural colours from nature.

# Typography

I choose the font '' this font has a nice clear look, which is a little bit like clear fancy handwriting, this stands out well and fits the style of the restaurant.
