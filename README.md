# Color Scheme

The colour scheme is that of a white background to keep things professional and then pops of colour in the site. The colours will be based upon more natural hues, such as:

* blue, green and yellow.
* normal shade of white
* basic shade of black

  The reason for the colou choice is a health product, so it made sense to use more natural colours from nature.

# Typography

I choose the font '' this font has a nice clear look, which is a little bit like clear fancy handwriting, this stands out well and fits the style of the restaurant.
